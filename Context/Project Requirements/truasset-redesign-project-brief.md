# TruAsset Website Redesign & ADA Compliance

**Project Context, Communication Summary, and Execution Direction**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Stakeholders

-   **Client:** Jason Byers (TruAsset)\
-   **Agency:** Brandcave\
-   **Project Lead:** Cody Miles (Brandcave)\
-   **Designer:** Val Vinnakota (Brandcave)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Client Concern & Initial Request (ADA Compliance Risk)

> "It seems ambulance-chasing lawyers are going to websites to check ADA
> compliance, and if it's not 100%, they sue the companies for not
> complying with Federal Law.

> I would say this was a gimmick, but one of my brother-in-law's
> customers just got sued, and it was expensive to settle. I checked
> here and we get a 47%. That's not good.

> https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/audit/?website=www.truasset.com&flag=us

> I think its time for TruAsset to get an update anyway so what would
> you charge me for a revamp of the look and to get truasset.com up to
> 100% ADA Compliance?"

## Brandcave Response & Options Proposed

> "Absolutely. There's a few options here:

> 1.  **ADA plugin:** There are WordPress plugins that enable larger
>     text, higher contrast and more. The least expensive option would
>     be enabling a plugin like this.

> 2.  **Website Revamp:** In this case, we'll design some updated mocks
>     to the site to have higher contrast and larger font sizes.

> Regardless of the above options, we will need to ensure all images
> have alt text. That's just development work that needs to happen.

> I'd suggest starting with the ADA plugin and redesigning the site, if
> needed. What do you think?"

## Client Direction & Decision

> "A new streamlined, modernized website is the way to go. In the
> meantime, let's install the ADA plugin. It's at least a band-aid, and
> you have our basic text and color schemes. Throw together some
> mock-ups and let us know."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Internal Project Mission for Val

> "I also forwarded you an email from TruAsset. Read the email thread.
> We designed and built a website for them several years ago. They're
> wanting to modernize the look-and-feel of the site and meet ADA
> compliance.

> I'd like to ask you create a couple mocks of their homepage. Content
> can change, if needed. Here's a few sites I'd like you to look at for
> inspiration:

> https://acquire.com/\
> https://www.unloop.so/\
> https://getclair.com/

> Make a plan and then let me know."

## Design Direction & Workflow Clarification

### Questions from Val

> "Hey Cody, regarding the TruAsset website redesign, could you please
> answer the following questions for my direction and plan?"

> "Would you like me to create mocks on Figma only or do you think the
> client could be interested to see vibe coded options as well (and
> maybe use one of those for dev hand-off?)"

--- **Val**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Cody's Guidance

> "You can vibe code.

> What I like to do is find websites I like and scrape them with a
> html.to.figma plugin and then use a figma MCP to build it.

> But, importantly, you should know that whatever you vibe code cannot
> be used on the site because ultimately there will be a WordPress theme
> we need to update.

> So, whatever you do has to be ultimately put back into Figma."

--- **Cody**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Platform & Technology Clarification

> "I noticed that their current website is using WordPress + Bootstrap
> (Understrap theme). Would they still like to continue using WordPress
> to build it out as well? If so, I could setup the design system on
> Figma (or Cursor) to be a 'Bootstrap 5 UI Kit' and proceed to create
> the mocks for the homepage variations."

--- **Val**

> "They'll stay in WordPress."

--- **Cody**

> "Actually it would be better if your vibe coded thing was just
> **HTML + JS + CSS**. I can integrate that into the WordPress theme
> pretty easily."

--- **Cody**

> "Sweet! I'll vibe code the variants to be simple HTML + JS + CSS only
> without a framework, then."

--- **Val**

> "Sweet!"

## Website Inspiration References

-   https://acquire.com/\
-   https://www.unloop.so/\
-   https://getclair.com/ *(Val's preferred reference)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Additional Notes

-   The current TruAsset website is built on **WordPress + Bootstrap
    (Understrap theme)**.
-   Vibe-coded output is intended for **design exploration and
    direction**, not direct production usage.
-   **Figma will remain the source of truth** for all finalized designs.
-   ADA compliance is a **core requirement**, not an afterthought.
-   Accessibility improvements must be baked into design decisions
    (contrast, typography, hierarchy), not just handled via plugins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Note to Cursor

> *Find additional examples of modern, accessible marketing websites
> similar in nature to TruAsset, or any sites that strongly align with
> ADA-first, clean, and modern design principles for inspiration.*
