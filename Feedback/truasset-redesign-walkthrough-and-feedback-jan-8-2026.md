## Walkthrough & Demo Transcript (Val)

**Transcript begins below. Timestamps and wording are preserved exactly
as provided.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**0:02** Hickory, Updates in True Asset. So I've gone through the
references of the websites and even more out there. Turns out most of
them does not, uh, you know, do the 90 percent.

**0:17** It has Jason wanted, uh, even for references, although I really
love it Claire. I have inspired from some of those, but I figured I
really need to get into the website and see what did not, uh, work.

**0:30** So I on the wave tool and went through individually what didn't
work. The first time, so I'm making sure we don't do that again.

**0:38** Uh, so what I did was making it compliant, uh, to the ADS
course, I made a simple four variations of websites through webcoding
that I- just, uh, at CSS, JS, and HTML, and nothing much more.

**0:56** The first example, as you can see is, uh, I did not deviate
much from the design, uh, you know, look and feel, such as the color,
things, et cetera.

**1:05** So, here's the variation one, maybe have the header section a
bit more dark and with higher contrast ratios. I request them on watch
video.

**1:15** I wanted some motion on this, not just the scroll effect, so I
kind of left these hovering elements, uh. Ignore the images, uh, I'm
gonna make sure the final part wouldn't have these extra bits or
borders.

**1:32** They're compliance logos. Lewis. And the features of, uh, the
product itself. And exporting for the features as action for that.

**1:51** And here are the custom. This is gonna be a carousel over here.
I use the same images they have on their website, uh, just to see if we
get all the content right.

**2:07** And finally the, the CTA for requesting a demo. And the footer
with variable links in there. Moving on to the second one.

**2:22** This variation is much more inspired by what we have on Apple.
So a simple hero section with mostly clear contrast and ratios here.

**2:33** Again, I'll use a better image and maybe I'll even strike some
bolder, you know, pattern breaks or section breaks in other variations.

**2:45** Or the feature list without borders, uh, for simplicity. And
here's where they can explore more features, some stats, go after it is.

**2:57** Spanning here. And, they custom it in our CD, put it with
external links. It's another variation, much more similar to the first
one.

**3:12** But I wanted to, show that we can do that, not just in the
darker theme, but even in the lighter theme.

**3:20** Uh, what did this affect, but I guess it's worth learning how
to fix that. And the features are now shown as a, Dabs, uh, again, like
this, I'm going to shoot here where the images are kind of expanding the
box area.

**3:37** I'll fix that and make sure they're all, I'll fix tights. And
integrations as styles. And finally the CTA. For down links.

**3:55** The fourth one is something I'm still working on. Uh, it's
gonna be, uh, a bit more. With respect to the same as the first one,
but, uh, slightly different.

**4:09** Right. Some unique patterns here. I've added some more extra.
So this is one I'm trying to change the content or adding different- and
sections that are running there on the original website.

**4:20** So like Test Tomorrow section over here. And feature list, uh,
much more simpler. Finally, a CTA. And footer with links.

**4:32** What I'm gonna do is- It is, uh, try to add more bolder, color
schema, gradients, et cetera, make it more modern.

**4:40** But all the while I'm making sure I'm checking for the ADA
compliance so that the contrast is just the- even the- the area rolls
and the- alt, uh, you know, text are all available for- of them within
HTML.

**4:54** So whichever they choose, it's- we can ultimately use that code
directly in WordPress. Thank you.

## Cody's Feedback (Post-Demo)

**Summary of feedback provided by Cody after reviewing the
walkthrough:**

> Good progress.\
> I don't love your second iteration. I'd like to see something closer
> to what I did for Ledgerwise.
>
> I don't love the hero for iteration 3 but I do like the feature
> section.\
> Let's get the Ledgerwise-like version in there and then we can send
> some mocks to Jason for review.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Takeaways (Implicit Direction)

-   Iteration 2 is not aligned with Cody's expectations and should be
    deprioritized or reworked.
-   Iteration 3 has a **strong feature section**, but the **hero needs
    revision**.
-   Cody wants a new variation that is **closer to the Ledgerwise design
    approach**.
-   Next milestone:
    -   Incorporate a Ledgerwise-inspired version
    -   Prepare polished mocks
    -   Share with Jason (client) for review
